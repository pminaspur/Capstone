#Artifacts Enhancements
##CS499 Computer Science Capstone 

Content

My artifact enhancements demonstrated my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. In this role, I developed functionalities to creatively select data structures and develop algorithms, enhancing the system's overall performance and value in line with industry objectives of providing efficient and scalable solutions.

My work consisted of designing and evaluating computational solutions that solve given problems based on algorithmic principles, computer science practices, and standards relevant to their solution while managing tradeoffs associated with design choices by considering the relationship and functionality of the different classes and methods by 
refining the data structure and algorithms to illustrate my capacity for creating efficient solutions. 

All of the enhanced artists demonstrate how I strive to apply a security mindset to software architectures and designs, anticipating adversarial exploits, exposing vulnerabilities, mitigating design flaws, and ensuring data privacy and enhanced security.
