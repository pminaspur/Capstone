## Overview

A rescue animal training company, Grazioso Salvare, aims to identify dogs that make good candidates for their search-and-rescue training programs. After these dogs are trained, they can rescue both humans and dogs from life-threatening conditions. In collaboration with animal shelters in Austin, Texas, Grazioso Salvare selects dogs for their training program. The Grazioso Salvare dog training program does have a specific profile they are looking for in dogs to train. With the help of this program, GS will be able to identify and categorize available dogs based on existing data from Austin animal shelters. The project aims to enable users to generate new animal entries and locate those already in the database. The purpose of this project is to assist in organizing the shelter's animal database. Making creating, reading, updating, and deleting database operations functional.
