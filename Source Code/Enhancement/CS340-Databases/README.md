# Rescue Web Application(Databases)
## CS340 Client/Server Development
### Overview

The primary objective of this web application was to develop an interactive and operational dashboard for identifying and categorizing available dogs based on data from Austin's animal shelters. The CS340 Client/Server development course provided students with the opportunity to conceptualize and develop a web application. This full-stack application aimed to create a Traveller website using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. A MEAN stack architecture is used in this application, featuring MongoDB as the database, Express as the web framework, Angular as the front-end framework, and Node.js as the web server.

The source code in this module is well-documented and supports clean code through descriptive function and variable names, as well as easy-to-maintain comments. Various database operations are carried out in this project using MongoDB, including querying, retrieving results, writing and deleting data, and running commands in the database
