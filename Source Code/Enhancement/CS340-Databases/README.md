# Rescue Web Application(Databases)
## CS340 Client/Server Development
### Overview

The primary objective of this web application was to develop an interactive and operational dashboard for identifying and categorizing available dogs based on data from Austin's animal shelters. The CS340 Client/Server development course provided students with the opportunity to conceptualize and develop a web application. This full-stack application aimed to create a Traveller website using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. A MEAN stack architecture is used in this application, featuring MongoDB as the database, Express as the web framework, Angular as the front-end framework, and Node.js as the web server.

The source code in this module is well-documented and supports clean code through descriptive function and variable names, as well as easy-to-maintain comments. Various database operations are performed in this project using MongoDB, including querying, retrieving results, writing and deleting data, and executing commands within the database.

I made well-informed choices and ensured a cohesive development process that facilitated the smooth integration of various components within the application, which deepened my appreciation for the comprehensive knowledge I acquired. The CS 340 project focused on designing and building a multi-tier application that utilized a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and a RESTful API. Thus, I have designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.

This artifact utilizes industry-standard Python code best practices, which enhances readability by formatting the code according to the relevant coding standards. Line breaks are included, and the source code is organized effectively, uniformly, and consistently. With the new enhancements, implement valuable and innovative computer solutions that align with industry-specific goals. In the course of this study, I discovered Aggregation in MongoDB, which serves as a powerful framework for executing complex data transformations, calculations, and analyses on groups of documents. By utilizing the aggregation pipeline, we can derive significant insights through grouping, filtering, sorting, reshaping, and calculating data. My understanding of the data analysis process has been enhanced by this course, as well as my ability to utilize these tools effectively. This project will also be beneficial when I seek employment or attend interviews, in addition to being part of my portfolio. Through this work, I have gained knowledge, skills, and experience, enabling me to meet my personal and professional objectives.<br><br>
