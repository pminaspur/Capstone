Q.1) How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing clean, maintainable, and readable code is imperative for any software project to succeed. Using well-organized codes that are easy to follow, extend, and modify also speeds up development, reducing the likelihood of bugs and errors. Well-designed modules can be reused across different parts of your application, saving development time and promoting consistency. 
The program should be written with the understanding that you or another developer may need to revisit it and modify it in the future.
Descriptive variable and function names are the cornerstones of readable code. 
Readability means following a logical order in your code and making thorough comments that tell the reader what they are looking at. 
A program must be maintained to add functionality and remain up-to-date, which requires modularity and reuse. 
It allows you to build upon a program without having to rewrite things all the time. In the event of a change, only the specific module must be modified, minimising the risk of errors in other parts of the codebase. 
Well-designed modules can be reused across different parts of your application, saving development time and promoting consistency.
Also, the self-documenting approach saves time and frustration when revisiting code.  
With the Python CRUD module, we created new functions every week, like building blocks, and it was easy to incorporate into future modules. Therefore, writing the code once and reusing it in multiple programs will result in fewer repetitions, fewer errors, and better maintenance. This module may prove helpful if I need to access another MongoDB instance as my use grows.

Q.2) How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, my approach to problems involves analyzing the goal and requirements, and figuring out how to implement those requirements with the tools I have at my disposal. As a result, I would build the most basic tools first, followed by the code for executing them. I found this project to be quite different from my other courses. Using databases was my first experience. My favorite part was building the database, developing the CRUD module, and then incorporating it into the interactive page. In the future, I will use these methods of creating and aggregating data from databases to create more value for my clients' software. The CRUD module, particularly the techniques I have learned here, will be useful.

Q.3) What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists apply their knowledge and skills to optimize, streamline, or improve processes to maximize workplace efficiency. Writing code from scratch, updating/enhancing existing code, and developing software that processes data faster than humans has improved the lives and careers of people and businesses. It matters because computers have changed the way we live. All you need to do these days is type your questions into any number of search engines and you will find answers. With computer scientists, video games and 3d animated films would exist. We would live in a smaller, slower-moving, less connected world. My work on these projects can help companies become more efficient by giving them better workflow information and streamlining those processes to maximize profits. For this project, the company had specific breeds and ages of dogs in mind. A manual search of the 10,000 dog records would take hours. The result of this project is a faster, more efficient, and more expandable way to complete that job.
