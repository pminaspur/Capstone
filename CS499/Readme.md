Overview

In this repository, I detail the process I followed to create my digital portfolio for the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course final project. A professional portfolio that visually and technically represents my best work through a collection of significant projects. My e-portfolio demonstrates a profound understanding of the fundamental aspects of computer science, including programming languages, algorithms, data structures, and software development methodologies. Additionally, the document will focus on the practical experiences and problem-solving abilities acquired from both projects and coursework. By featuring my notable completed projects, contributions to open-source initiatives, and personal development efforts, I demonstrated my skills and expertise to potential employers. Furthermore, by illustrating my coding techniques, structure, and knowledge of various frameworks and programming languages, I demonstrate my proficiency in programming languages and my ability to produce clear, concise code. In my portfolio, I also emphasized specific in-demand technical terminology, enhancing my visibility to recruiters.
